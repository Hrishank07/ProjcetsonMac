#So this is the README.md file for the Autobot project.

The main aim of this project is to be an autonomous bot that applies to jobs for you. It will be able to do the following:
1. Apply to jobs on LinkedIn.
2. Apply to jobs on Indeed.
3. Apply to jobs on Glassdoor.


##
It will ask you for your resume and cover letter and then it will apply to jobs for you. It will also be able to send you notifications when a job is posted that matches your criteria.

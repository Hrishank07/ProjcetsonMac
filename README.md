- Well this is a repository consisting of my personal projects through my Student life.
- This repo majorly focuses on the projects that are working towards the Data Analysis and Machine Learning.
- I will be including the tech stack that i will be using for the projects and will help me keep a track of my skills and projects

## Tech Stack
- Languages: Python, R, SQL, Java
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, NLTK, OpenCV, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Flask, Django
- ETL Tools: Talend, Informatica, Hadoop, Spark
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Hadoop, Hive, HBase
- Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure
- Big Data: Hadoop, Spark, Kafka
- Visualization: Tableau, PowerBI, QlikView
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Angular, Node.js, Express.js

## Projects

### 1. Projects On Time Series Analysis:
- **Description**: These are a couple of projects that i have worked through in my course and then implemented them in my personal projects. Theres a final project based on NYC Taxi Data Analysis which involves a detailed EDA and Time Series Analysis considering various factors. Combining the data with the weather data and then predicting the future demand of the taxis. EDA consisted of the data cleaning, data visualization, feature engineering and then the model building. The language used was primarily R and then various libraries like ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, forecast, tseries, etc. We implemented ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters, Prophet and LSTM models for the prediction as well as the forecasting.

- **Tech Stack**: R, ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, forecast, tseries, ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters, Prophet, LSTM
